#       METHOD OF CHEAPEST INSERTION
# 1. Choose an arbitrary node i as a starting node.
# 2. Find a node j closest to i. Form a subtour T = i-j-i.
# 3. Find an edge [i,j] of the subtour and a node k not in the subtour, such that the increase of
# length f = c + c - c is minimized. Modify the subtour by inserting k between i and j. ik kj ij
# 4. Go to 3 until a Hamiltonian cycle is formed.
